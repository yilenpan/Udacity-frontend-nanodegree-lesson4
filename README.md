## Abstract:

## JS Optimization:

Introduced Array.sample prototype to simplify and refactor all of the
randomize functions.

Introduced String.itemizer prototype which takes a string and wraps it with <li> tags

Made adjectives, nouns, words, into global variables so that functions can call on array
rather than initalize three large arrays when the functions are called.

Pulled out the document.selectors out of all of the loops to minimize number of calls to the dom.

Removed unnecessary calculations from loops to minimize computational use.

Instead of writing a new style, change the class name of RandomPizza to a different col-md-#.

Removed all inline styles and put them in the head of the pizza.html file.
